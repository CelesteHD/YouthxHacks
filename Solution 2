#Solution 2; targetting algae bloom in fish farms which reduces food safety and sustainability. Algae bloom promotes the growth of phytoplankton which harms the fishes.
#To target this issue, we have come up with a 3 phase solution that capture, contain and cleans.
#With the use of technology, we apply these 3 phases by firstly, capture: Monitoring of oxygen levels and presence of algae (via AI). Secondly, containing by 
#improving aeration of water to restore oxygen levels. Lastly, cleaning by the release of hydrogen peroxide to suppress algae growth.
#With these 3 phases, we hope to increase the sustainability of fishes in the fish farm which would lead to an increase in fish produce for consumption.
#this will allow us to increase the food supply and thus allow food security.
#Aeration will occur when either the oxygen levels become < 5ppm or when Algae is detected by the AI system. Whilst Hydrogen peroxide will be secreted into the waters 
#as long as algae is detected by the AI system. This will reduce algae bloom and keep the waters clean thus allowing a larger supply of fresh fishes to be available
#for consumption.

#The following lines of code is a basic algorithm of how the AI could work. ( Coded using Python )

fishes = int(input("Enter number of fishes in the tank:"))
oxygenLevel = 15 # 5-20 ppm is at normal level. Input of OxygenLevel will be retrieved through the sensor.
AlgaeDetected = 0 #+1 when algae detected
AlgaePresent = False #If algae is present after detection, it will turn True automatically
AIscan = 0 # every increment = scan the tank once
aeration= 0 #increment of Aeration = process will take place once
HydrogenP = 0 #increment of HydrogenP = Hydrogen Peroxide will be secreted into the waters at a certain amount
AIscan +=1
if AlgaeDetected == 1:
  AlgaePresent = True
if oxygenLevel <5 or AlgaePresent == True: #Oxygen level <5ppm OR Algae is present, Aeration will occur.
   aeration +=1
   AlgaePresent = False
if AlgaePresent == True:
  HydrogenP +=1 #hydrogen peroxide will released upon the detection of algae bloom.
  AlgaePresent = False
