#manual pollination -> pollination using technology
#2 functions of U+2698
#first function (male plants are placed on conveyor belt) ; input the total number of male plants and allow them to move through U+2698 on a conveyer belt. When a plant is detected by the machine, it will
#use the cotton swab to swab the anthers (male part of the plant where the pollens are) of the plant. The pollen grains on the anthers is now transferred to the cotton swabs.
#Once funcntion 1 is achieved, U+2698 will start completing function 2

#second function (female plants are placed on conveyor belt)
#U+2698 will take the cotton swab and dab it onto the stigma (female part of the plant where fertilisation can occur) of the female plant so that it can be pollinated.
#the number of male and female plants are to be inputted by the user of the machines. A simple algorithmn to demonstrate how it works is below in python.

#Phase 1; machine for male plants. ensure all plants are on the conveyer belt ( FUNCTION 1 )


MalePlants = int(input("Enter the number of male plants going through the machine."))
Conveyer = 0 #every increment of Conveyer = Conveyer will move 
dab = 0 #every increment of dab = the machine will dab the cotton swab on to the male plant
pass = 0 #passes it on to machine 2 ( also counts the number of cotton swabs with pollen available to use on machine 2 )
while Conveyer < MalePlants:
  dab +=1 #machine dabs the cotton swab onto male plant
  pass +=1
  Conveyer +=1

#Phase 2; machine for female plants: where pollination occurs. Ensure all female plants are on the conveyer belt. ( FUNCTION 2 )

FemalePlants = int(input("Enter number of female plants going through the machine."))
Conveyer = 0 #every increment = move the conveyer belt
dab = 0 #dab the cotton swab with pollens on to the stigma of the plant.
dispose = 0 #disposes the cotton swab into a small compartment of the machine
print("The number of pollinations that can be made is", pass)
for i in range(pass):
  dab +=1
  dispose +=1
  Conveyer +=1




#With the use of technology to help make pollination more efficient, pollination will be able to occur at a faster pace and thus would allow a larger number of crops
#to be produced in a shorter number of time. This will increase the sustainability of crops and thus increases food security and sustainability.
